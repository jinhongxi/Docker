1. At what size N does your Euclidean norm start to exhibit unexpected results? What is the approximate magnitude of the unexpected result? Explain.
At size 72, the difference between n1(ascending order) and n2(descending order) becomes a non-zero value.  The approximate magnitude of the unexpected result is about 5.0043.  This is probably caused because as the sum

2. Is this going to be a problem with our realization of vector spaces as vector<double>?
