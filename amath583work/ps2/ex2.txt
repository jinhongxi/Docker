1. At what size N does your Euclidean norm start to exhibit unexpected results? What is the approximate magnitude of the unexpected result? Explain.
At the size 71, the difference between n1 and n2 becomes non-zero suddenly.  This is probabilly caused by the fact that when compared with the sum, the entry is small, system stops adding up.  

2. Is this going to be a problem with our realization of vector spaces as vector<double>?
At size 71, the Euclidean norm cannot sum up, thus, the value of the L2 norm do not be exactly correct and therefore cannot operate on a vector space anymore.
