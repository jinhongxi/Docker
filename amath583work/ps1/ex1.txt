-------------------------

1. What is the complete string in your bash shell prompt when your working directory is /home/amath583/work?
   Bash Shell Prompt = "amath583@" + Container ID + ":~/work$"
   eg:  amath583@c2a07f74a6a9:~/work$
   The container ID varies as exiting and running the docker container.

2. What is the indicated host name of your amath583/base container? (You will need to find the right Linux command to execute for this.)
   $ docker ps -a
   CONTAINER ID               NAMES
   c2a07f74a6a9        friendly_einstein
   0476a40eee02        adoring_clarke
   46a9697e5bcf        boring_kowalevski
   56848a77be5c        pensive_agnesi
   641751e74b1b        relaxed_pare
   The container ID and the host name varies as exiting and running docker.

3. How do you specify the name of an output file when you use the compiler?
   $ c++ -c vsum.cpp -o vsum.out
   $ c++ -c vsum2.cpp -o vsum2.out

4. (583 only) Describe how you would separately compile the two files vsum2.cpp and vector.cpp into object files and link them to create an executable.
   $ c++ -c vector.cpp -o vector.o
   $ c++ -c vsum2.cpp -o vs2.o
   $ c++ -o vector.o vs2.o -o vsum2_exe
   $ ./vsum2_exe
   In both "vsum2.cpp" and "vector.cpp", a header file "vector.h" is included.
   The first two lines are to compile the source files into two object files, the third line is to create one executable file with the two object files, and the fourth lien is for try-out.
